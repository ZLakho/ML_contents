m = x-axis
b= y-axis
alpha=learning rate
prediction algorithm:

linear regression:
first a random line will be generated by our algorithm then with the help of optiization algorithm we will find graph which will be hidden to computer.
how will optimization algorithm tells that we have to increase the value of m and b or decrease?
by creatig a random line on graph,it will ask OA to tell for values, OA then will derivate those points on graph and create a slop of these values (if the slope 
is negative ,it will suggest to increase the value of m and b or if the value of slope is positive it wil suggest to decrease the values of m and b).

polynomial regression: include equation of second degree or greater---->here comes he concepts of:
1. overfitting: training accuracy is well but testing accuracy is worst-->need to lower the complexity of algorithm
2. underfitting: training accuracy is worst and testing accuracy is also worst-->need to work on the complexity of algorithm
3. bestfitting: predictions are not accurately 100% correct but fulfill our expectations. 
all the stuff comes under the concept of conventional ML.
